Hi everyone,

This app is designed to manage service requests within a hotel.

Previously, I worked in a hotel where I had to handle requests made to different staff members. 
These requests were typically relayed through WhatsApp or phone calls to the appropriate department. 
Managing these requests was a lengthy process, often requiring multiple steps before they were completed.

To address this, I developed software that brings everyone together in one platform. 
It allows staff to share essential information, such as the time taken to complete tasks and requests, who is on break, and other valuable details. 
The software also includes various features to streamline hotel operations.

Here is how you can access the app:
